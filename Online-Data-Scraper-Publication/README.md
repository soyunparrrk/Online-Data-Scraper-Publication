Downloaded Github and figured out how to commit and push.

Searched for inspiration and found Google autocomplete API. Also learnt how to use node.js. 

1. node -v on terminal to check whether I have node or not
2. Copy the code from the node website, paste it in a new file and save. (file name ex. app.js)
3. cd it in terminal. It will show the server address.
4. I can access the address through a web browser.
